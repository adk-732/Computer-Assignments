			<h2>What are Keys in DBMS?</h2>
			<p>In a Database Management System (DBMS), a key is a single or combination of multiple columns in a table that uniquely identifies a record in the table.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Types of Keys</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Primary Key (PK)</strong>
					<p>A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each record is unique. A primary key cannot be null, and it must be unique for each record.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Unique Key (UK)</strong>
					<p>A unique key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table, but can be null. It is used to ensure that each record has a unique value for the specified column(s), but it does not enforce data integrity like a primary key.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Foreign Key (FK)</strong>
					<p>A foreign key is a column or set of columns that references the primary key of another table. It is used to establish relationships between tables and ensure data consistency.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Composite Key</strong>
					<p>A composite key is a primary key that consists of multiple columns. It is used when a single column is not enough to uniquely identify each record in a table.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Super Key</strong>
					<p>A super key is a set of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table, but may not be minimal. It is a superset of a candidate key.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Candidate Key</strong>
					<p>A candidate key is a minimal super key that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It is a set of columns that can be used as a primary key.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Importance of Keys</h2>
			<p>Keys play a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and consistency in a database. They help to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Uniquely identify each record in a table</li>
				<li>Prevent data duplication</li>
				<li>Establish relationships between tables</li>
				<li>Improve data retrieval and query performance</li>
			</ul>
